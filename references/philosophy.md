## Module 00: Foundational Philosophy

### The Director's Three Laws

**Law I — Specificity is kindness.**  
Specify what is observable (frame), audible (sound), and temporal (when). But only specify what the model cannot infer on its own.

**Law II — The model reads left-to-right, early tokens weighted heavily.**  
The first 20–30 words carry disproportionate weight. Place your subject anchor and primary action there. Hard constraints early, emotional/stylistic polish last.

**Law III — Know the model's strengths; work with them.**  
Seedance 2.0 excels at:
- Atmosphere and environmental mood
- Organic human motion and physics
- Large-scale VFX and creature generation
- Cinematic lighting shifts
- Camera movement replication
- Multi-shot editing with sound
- Audio-video co-generation
- Brand/domain world knowledge
- Martial arts and fight choreography
- Beat-synced editing

It struggles with:
- Dense on-screen text and typography
- Perfect finger articulation in close-up
- Tiny mechanical precision
- Ultra-busy scenes with too many simultaneous moving parts
- Maintaining objects under high-speed motion
