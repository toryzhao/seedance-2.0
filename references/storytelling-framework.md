# Storytelling Framework · Seedance 2.0
Derived from professional cinematography and narrative design principles. Use this framework to elevate single clips into cinematic moments and short stories into immersive experiences.

## 1. The Narrative Core (The "Why")
Before defining the "What," establish the emotional anchor of the scene.
- **The Hook**: What is the first thing that grabs the viewer? (e.g., a guilty glance, a mysterious glow).
- **The Conflict**: What is the tension? (e.g., a time-reversal rebuilding a ruin, a pilot's determination before launch).
- **The Resolution**: How does the tension release? (e.g., a subtle smile, a final beauty shot of the product).

## 2. Visual Layering (The "How")
A cinematic shot is never just one thing; it's a stack of layers.
- **Subject Layer**: Primary and secondary subjects with specific attributes (e.g., "platinum armor with golden runes").
- **Action Layer**: Primary motion + secondary micro-movements (e.g., "breathing," "fingers touching," "dust settling").
- **Environmental Layer**: Atmosphere, weather, and props that react to the action (e.g., "mist pooling in river bends," "shockwave dispersing clouds").

## 3. The Director's Toolkit
Use these techniques to guide the AI's "eye."
- **Temporal Sequence**: Define the flow of time (e.g., "swirl → lift → tilt → drop falls").
- **Camera Language**: Use specific lenses (e.g., "100mm macro") and movements (e.g., "slow crane rise") to establish mood.
- **Physics & Constraints**: Explicitly state how elements should behave (e.g., "petals must fall with realistic air resistance," "liquid must obey fluid dynamics").

## 4. Genre-Specific Mastery
- **Luxury/Product**: Focus on macro details, refraction, and "beauty frames."
- **Action/Fantasy**: Focus on energy effects, scale, and environmental impact (shockwaves).
- **Anime/Stylized**: Focus on "hyper-detailed backgrounds," "volumetric lighting," and "emotional peaks."
- **Documentary/POV**: Focus on "authentic texture," "handheld micro-shake," and "natural lighting."

## 5. The "Anti-Slop" Protocol
Avoid generic AI descriptions. Instead of "beautiful," use "volumetric golden-hour lighting." Instead of "fast," use "catapult launch with twin thruster trails of blue fire."
- **Be Specific**: Name the material (copper, brass, silk).
- **Be Sensory**: Describe the sound (crisp cap-twist, low ambient hum).
- **Be Physical**: Describe the weight and interaction (mat compression under feet, body weight distribution).
