## Introduction

**SEEDANCE 2.0 — THE DIRECTOR'S GRIMOIRE (v3)**

The definitive pipeline standard for quad-modal AI filmmaking (T2V · I2V · V2V · R2V) with native audio-video joint generation.

Seedance 2.0 is not just a renderer — it is a co-director. It has world knowledge, narrative intelligence, and cinematographic instinct. Your job is to decide **when to direct precisely** and **when to delegate to its intelligence**.

This skill document represents the cumulative knowledge of 150+ prompt variations, stress-tested workflows, and verified platform behaviors as of Q1 2026.
