## Module 00A: Director's Vision

**A technically correct prompt that produces meaningless footage is still a failure.**

Before writing the technical prompt, answer five questions:

1. **What must the audience feel** (one emotion)?
2. **What changes by the end** (transformation)?
3. **What is the single most meaningful moment** (timestamp)?
4. **Why is the camera where it starts?**
5. **What is the sonic world** (even if implied)?

### 3-Second Rule

If you cannot describe what happens in any 3-second window, the shot is drifting.

### Exit Rule

Land the last frame and last second of audio together. If motion is mid-gesture at cutoff, the clip feels accidental. Specify "final frame holds for 0.5–1s" when appropriate.
